# hello-world
Welcome to my repository, my world!
I am a researcher at the Consumer Data Research Centre, Leeds Institute for Data Analytics
My current interests lie in developing a framework for using big data in urban mobility and movement patterns analysis. 
I develop applications of spatial micro-simulation methods when the datasets are biased or skewed
I develop GIS-GTFS network models to identify the context in which rail passengers use the network
Welcome to my world!
